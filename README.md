#VGCamera - valerino's glass camera
##Google glass camera as it should have been

#features:
. totally controlled by voice ('take a picture', 'record a video', 'stop video')
. zoom control ('in zoom', 'out zoom', 'max zoom', 'reset zoom')
. close by voice ('close')
. overlay (shows zoom/info, toggable with 'hide overlay', 'show overlay')

This is currently reaaaaaally WIP (started 2 hours ago after i managed to fix my glass for the foil issue!).
I was so excited to have my glass back that i decided to quickly hack an app with features i always wanted :)

#Currently implemented:
. all of the above in preview mode

#TODO:
. miss the actual take photo/video code :) but it's trivial, i'll do it tomorrow/in the next days!
. some touch gestures (zoom/take picture/video by touchpad)
. some other controls if possible (need to check what the camera hardware supports...)

#Compile with:
. the usual android studio (needs Android SDK 19 with the Glass Preview SDK)

cowabunga, ciao, bacetti :)
